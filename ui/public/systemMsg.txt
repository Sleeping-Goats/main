Article name: Precoated steel plate, welded blank, part and methods
URL: Summary: A method for fabricating a precoated steel plate involves dipping a steel plate in a molten bath to coat the plate with an intermetallic alloy layer and a metal alloy layer. The intermetallic alloy layer is specifically formulated to improve corrosion resistance, while the metal alloy layer provides additional protection against corrosion and wear. The resulting precoated steel plate offers enhanced performance in harsh environments.
